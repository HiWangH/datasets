An assignment mixed integer linear programming model is formulated, which solves the problem of
how to combine orders in delivery to save the total transportation cost when orders with both single and multiple
destinations exist.

This paper
investigates the pairing of containers/orders in drayage transportation from the perspective of delivering paired
containers on 40-ft truck and/or individual containers on 20-ft truck,

An assignment mixed integer linear programming model is formulated 
the proposed model is that it can be implemented on different variants of the container drayage problem
The proposed model can be solved to optimality efficiently (within half hour) for over 300 orders.
